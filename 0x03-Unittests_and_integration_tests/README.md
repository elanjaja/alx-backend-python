0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests
Alx project to demonstrate how to write unit and integration tests using the python unit testing framework and mock object library.

Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs.
Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.
